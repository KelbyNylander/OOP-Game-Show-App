Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree - Unit 4

A hangman style word game where a user tries to guess the phrase on screen and selections are handled using Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript.

A random phrase from an array of phrases and put on screen. The player "guesses" letters, if a guessed letter appears in the phrase, it is "revealed" in each spot where it appears. Each time a letter is guessed, that key is disabled on the keyboard and that letter's color changes to indicate that it is no longer available as a choice.

The game ends after 5 incorrect guesses or when the phrase is completed, and a "win" or "lose" message is displayed.

The virtual keyboard is disabled until the game is started
